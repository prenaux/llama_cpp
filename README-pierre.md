# llama.cpp

This includes notes about the changes I made to the repos and how to use it
with ham.

## Typical run

Here is a typical run using LLaMA-7B:

```java
make -j && ./main -m ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512

Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:
1) Select a domain name and web hosting plan
2) Complete a sitemap
3) List your products
4) Write product descriptions
5) Create a user account
6) Build the template
7) Start building the website
8) Advertise the website
9) Provide email support
10) Submit the website to search engines
A website is a collection of web pages that are formatted with HTML. HTML is the code that defines what the website looks like and how it behaves.
The HTML code is formatted into a template or a format. Once this is done, it is displayed on the user's browser.
The web pages are stored in a web server. The web server is also called a host. When the website is accessed, it is retrieved from the server and displayed on the user's computer.
A website is known as a website when it is hosted. This means that it is displayed on a host. The host is usually a web server.
A website can be displayed on different browsers. The browsers are basically the software that renders the website on the user's screen.
A website can also be viewed on different devices such as desktops, tablets and smartphones.
Hence, to have a website displayed on a browser, the website must be hosted.
A domain name is an address of a website. It is the name of the website.

And here is another demo of running both LLaMA-7B and [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) on a single M1 Pro MacBook:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/224442907-7693d4be-acaa-4e01-8b4f-add84093ffff.mp4

## Download & build the repo

```bash
# build this repo
git clone git@github.com:prenaux/llama.cpp.git
cd llama_cpp
make -j
```

## Usage with `_sync_data`

Here are the step for the LLaMA-7B model, assuming of have access the precomputed models (see rclone.conf):

```bash
# check what will be downloaded
./_sync_data.sh llama/7B pull

# do the download
./_sync_data.sh llama/7B pull doit

# run the inference
./main -m ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -n 128

# run another tests
./main -m ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512
```

## Usage if you don't have access to `_sync_data`

Here are the step for the LLaMA-7B model:

```bash
# obtain the original LLaMA model weights and place them in ./models/llama
ls ./models/llama
65B 30B 13B 7B tokenizer_checklist.chk tokenizer.model

# install Python dependencies
python3 -m pip install torch numpy sentencepiece

# convert the 7B model to ggml FP16 format
python3 convert-pth-to-ggml.py models/llama/7B/ 1

# quantize the model to 4-bits (using method 2 = q4_0)
./quantize ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-f16.bin ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin 2

# run the inference
./main -m ./models/llama/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -n 128
```

Currently, it's best to use Python 3.9 or Python 3.10, as `sentencepiece` has not yet published a wheel for Python 3.11.

When running the larger models, make sure you have enough disk space to store all the intermediate files.

### Memory/Disk Requirements

As the models are currently fully loaded into memory, you will need adequate disk space to save them
and sufficient RAM to load them. At the moment, memory and disk requirements are the same.

| model | original size | quantized size (4-bit) |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| 7B    | 13 GB         | 3.9 GB                 |
| 13B   | 24 GB         | 7.8 GB                 |
| 30B   | 60 GB         | 19.5 GB                |
| 65B   | 120 GB        | 38.5 GB                |

### Interactive mode

If you want a more ChatGPT-like experience, you can run in interactive mode by passing `-i` as a parameter.
In this mode, you can always interrupt generation by pressing Ctrl+C and enter one or more lines of text which will be converted into tokens and appended to the current context. You can also specify a *reverse prompt* with the parameter `-r "reverse prompt string"`. This will result in user input being prompted whenever the exact tokens of the reverse prompt string are encountered in the generation. A typical use is to use a prompt which makes LLaMa emulate a chat between multiple users, say Alice and Bob, and pass `-r "Alice:"`.

Here is an example few-shot interaction, invoked with the command

```bash
# default arguments using 7B model
./examples/chat.sh

# advanced chat with 13B model
./examples/chat-13B.sh

# custom arguments using 13B model
./main -m ./models/13B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -n 256 --repeat_penalty 1.0 --color -i -r "User:" -f prompts/chat-with-bob.txt
```

Note the use of `--color` to distinguish between user input and generated text.
